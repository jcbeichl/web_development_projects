					<h3>About Me</h3>
				<br>
						<p>Hi, I’m James and I live in Mesa, Arizona with my wife and daughter. I recently just started my Web Development certificate, which is the final step in completing my bachelor’s degree, and I couldn’t be more excited! Finding time to do homework can be a little difficult at times, especially with my family. But, I find the time to cram in as many hours as possible, so I can get back to entertaining my daughter. Beside working, going to school, being a husband and father, I do need to find time to do the things that I like. Those include working out, researching and experimenting with technology, and I recently just picked up woodworking. My time is limited but, I am a family man first which means everything else takes a backseat to them.</p>
